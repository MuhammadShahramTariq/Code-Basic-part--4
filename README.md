# Assignment 04 – File Handling in C++

## Overview
This project explores practical file-handling techniques in C++ through three applied exercises. It corresponds to Assignment No. 04 for Programming Fundamentals (Software Engineering, AIR University, Kamra).

## Programs Included
1. **Character Classifier**
   - Classifies input as lowercase, uppercase, digit, or invalid using ASCII ranges.
   - Appends results to `character classification.txt`.

2. **Employee Salary Manager**
   - Reads employee ID and base salary.
   - Applies increments:
     - 50% if salary is between 500 and 1000 (inclusive lower bound).
     - 20% if salary is greater than 1000.
   - Logs entries to `Employees.txt`.
   - Supports multiple entries via `do-while`.

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Records product ID, quantity, and price per item.
   - Calculates total value and applies a 21% discount for quantity ≥ 30.
   - Appends data to `Inventory.txt`.

## Key Concepts
- Conditional logic (`if-else`, `else if`)
- Loops (`do-while`)
- ASCII-based classification
- File I/O with `ofstream` (append mode)
- Basic data validation and record logging

## How to Run
1. Save each code snippet as a separate `.cpp` file (e.g., `char_classify.cpp`, `salary_manager.cpp`, `inventory.cpp`).
